## ðŸš€ How we have used **Github** in our project?

We used Github in different ways:

**Pull Requests and Issues:** As a team, we use GitHub pull requests to manage our work. When a team member has an idea for a new feature, they create an issue for the team to discuss and provide feedback on how to implement it..

**Github Branches** Github branches helped us beta test updated code before merging it into the original code. We used branches to create isolated environments for testing, which helped us to avoid conflicts and ensure that the new code was working as expected.

**Github Templates** We choose to use the MIT license for our project, and we added it to our repository using the default license template provided by GitHub.
